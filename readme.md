## Making Transfers Using VME/DSP General DMAC

This sample is a first demonstration of transferring data from main memory to VME/DSP internal 24-bit buffers, performed by the Media Engine itself.
The data is then modified and sent back to main memory to be displayed.

# Requirements
Run `./build.sh` from a bash shell.
